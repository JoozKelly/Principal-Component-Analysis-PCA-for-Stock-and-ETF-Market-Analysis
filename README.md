# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Stock and ETF Market Analysis

**Analyzing the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and ETF Returns using PCA**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains code and resources for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on stock market data, specifically focusing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) component stocks and ETFs. The goal is to identify the principal components that explain the most significant variance in stock and ETF returns, enabling insights into market dynamics and potential investment strategies.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Data Acquisition:** Retrieves historical stock and ETF data from financial data providers (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the data for PCA, including handling missing values and standardizing returns.
*   **PCA Implementation:** Performs Principal Component Analysis using libraries like scikit-learn.
*   **Variance Explained Analysis:** Calculates and visualizes the explained variance ratio for each principal component.
*   **Component Interpretation:** Analyzes the loadings (eigenvectors) to understand the contribution of each stock/ETF to the principal components.
*   **Visualization:** Provides visualizations of the explained variance and component loadings.
*   **Reproducible Analysis:**  Offers a structured and documented approach to conduct PCA on financial data.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **scikit-learn (sklearn):** For PCA implementation and related machine learning tasks.
*   **yfinance:** For downloading financial data from Yahoo Finance.
*   **matplotlib:** For creating visualizations.
*   **seaborn:** For enhanced visualizations (optional).
*   **NumPy:** For numerical computations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this repository, ensure that you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher is recommended. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **Pip:** Python package installer (usually included with Python).
*   **Required Python Packages:** Install the necessary packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn yfinance matplotlib numpy seaborn
    ```

## Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JoozKelly/Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-for-Stock-and-ETF-Market-Analysis.git
    cd Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-for-Stock-and-ETF-Market-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:** (If not already done)

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If a requirements.txt file exists in the repo. If not, install manually as shown in the prereqs section.
    ```

## Usage Guide

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   Ensure you have a list of stock tickers (e.g., DJIA components) or ETF symbols for analysis.
    *   Modify the data loading section within the main script to include the desired tickers/symbols.

2.  **Running the Analysis:**
    *   Execute the main Python script:

        ```bash
        python main.py  # Or the name of your main analysis script
        ```

3.  **Output Interpretation:**
    *   The script will generate visualizations and output relevant data, such as:
        *   Explained variance ratio per principal component.
        *   Loadings of each stock/ETF on the principal components.
        *   Visualizations of the explained variance and component loadings.

4.  **Customization:**
    *   Adjust parameters like the number of principal components to retain, the date range for data retrieval, and visualization settings within the script.
